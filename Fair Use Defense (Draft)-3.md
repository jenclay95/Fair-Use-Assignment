## Introduction   
Say you hear a well-known song, or maybe a not so well-known song, but someone has remixed it and you might like that version more than the original. Sometimes this happens. And sometimes it directly violates copyright law. However, there are certain ways through which people can get around the law. On the surface, taking a song that isn't yours, adding a few extra beats, and moving around sounds may appear to be a violation if not properly executed.

In this case, I will be arguing for the fair use of **[Dimond Saints' remix of the song _Never Gonna Change_ by the artist Broods](https://soundcloud.com/dimondsaints/broods-never-gonna-change)**. This song was published on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/stream), a popular music streaming website where up and coming artists publish their work. Oftentimes, this includes remixes and mashups, making SoundCloud a ground for potential copyright infringment.  
## Overview
If you've ever taken a song to use as background music for anything you create online, you may or may not have been in violation of copyrighted material. Copyright infringment is often difficult to get around, but when there is a probable defense to be made, this is called "fair use".   
### What is Fair Use? 
Generally speaking, most fair use cases involve a transformative or educational quality about them. [17 U.S. Code Chapter 1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107) highlights four main provisions of fair use, which are all subject to the own individual's assessment. 
### What Consitutes Fair Use? 
##### Four Factors of Fair Use 
 
1. First, the purpose and or character of the work must be brought into question. An assessment of whether it was made for commercial use or a non-profit educational use plays a role in determining if it is in fact a fair use of the copyrighted material. 
2. The nature of the copyrighted work is also a factor in determining fair use. 
3. Another factor to be considered is the amount taken from the copyrighted work in relation to the whole. This also includes the portion of the work and how substantial it is. 
4. Lastly, any effect on the potential market for the original copyrighted work is to be considered in a fair use argument. If the work in question has the potential to take profit away from the original artist, this may not be considered fair use. 

## In Defense of Dimond Saints' Remix
Does this remix qualify as fair use?

| Fair Use Factor  | Assessment of Fair Use | Explanation |
| -------------------   | ----| ----------- |
| Transformative Purpose | Yes  |  A remix, by its very definition, is transformative. The original has been reworked to create a new sound, separate from it's untouched state.  | 
| Nature of the Work | Yes  |   The original publishing date precedes the release of the remix, therefore the nature of the work is not disturbed.   |
| Amount & Portion | Maybe | The remix artists use a considerable amount of the original recording, though it is mainly a repetition of the chorus. |
| Negative Effect on Potential Market | Maybe | Although the remix is close enough that someone could choose this song over the original, SoundCloud has a relatively small membership and this remix probably doesn't reach many people. Also, SoundCloud is a free streaming website, and the song is available as a free download, so they don't profit directly.|

## Final Assessment
After carefully examining all anticipated defenses of fair use, I conclude that this remix is in not in violation of copyright law. Though some of the properties could be argued either way, most point to a fair use of the copyrighted material in question. The very nature of the song in question is transformative, as it is a remix of a song. Dimond Saints very carefully spent time going over how to put different snippets of the song in order to create a completely new experience for the listener. Secondly, the release of the original materials precedes the making of the remix, so it does not jeopardize the integrity of the original. The amount used in the reworking of the song is considerable, but the way they switch around the arrangment of these pieces makes it a very different final product. Lastly, SoundCloud's small audience does not cause a large threat to the original artist/label. Of course, if the original artist has objections regardless, their decision is supported, as they have all rights reserved to them. This is certainly a setback with copyright law as it stands.
